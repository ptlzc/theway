//! RFC 1 (issue #20) trigger envelope, source taxonomy, authority, state machine, and the
//! `TriggerRecord` persisted as `SessionTreeEntry::Custom { custom_type: "trigger" }`.
//!
//! This module is the runtime type surface for external-event-driven agent invocation. It
//! deliberately knows nothing about specific transports (MCP push, cron, file-watch, etc.).
//! Transport adapters live in `crates/harness` and consume the
//! [`NotificationHook`](super::notification_hook::NotificationHook) trait next door.
//!
//! Status: **types only**. The agent loop entrypoint
//! (`AgentHarness::handle_trigger(Trigger)`) and the runtime state machine wiring land in a
//! follow-up PR; this skeleton exists so Tools/MCP and Provider/Auth can build against the
//! envelope and trait shape in parallel.
