//! Cross-platform process memory introspection.
//!
//! Provides functions to query the current process's memory use and the host's
//! total physical memory — used to enforce an indexing memory budget so tgrep
//! doesn't OOM-kill the host on large monorepos.
//!
//! Two different quantities are available and they are not interchangeable:
//!
//! * **Resident set / working set** counts every physical page the process has
//!   mapped, *including* file-backed pages from `mmap`. Since indexing maps
//!   files at or above 1 MiB rather than reading them into heap, this number
//!   tracks the size of the files being indexed. Those pages are clean and
//!   file-backed, so the OS can drop them at any time without the process
//!   doing anything — they are not memory tgrep is holding.
//! * **Private bytes** counts only memory the process itself owns and must give
//!   back explicitly: heap, stacks, anonymous maps. This is what "how much
//!   memory does tgrep use" means, and it is what can actually exhaust a host.
//!
//! Indexing a single 2 GiB file peaks at 1.99 GiB working set but only 77.8 MiB
//! private, so reporting or budgeting against the working set overstates the
//! footprint by more than 25x. Prefer [`peak_private_bytes`] for reporting and
//! [`budgeted_memory_bytes`] for enforcing the cap; the RSS functions remain
//! for platforms that cannot separate the two.
