/// rules before it ever reaches the file that changes them. Answering for the
/// whole scan up front closes that window across directories as well.
///
/// Three tests, because none alone is enough.
///
/// Absence from the published sources is the exact question for an arrival —
/// this file did not feed the matcher in force — and it catches one however old

/// recency test.
///
/// A stamp mismatch answers the same question for a file that was *already* a
/// source: a pathname proves nothing about contents, and neither does
/// metadata. `rsync -a` and `tar -x` preserve mtime, and two different sets of
/// rules are easily the same length, so the comparison is against a hash of
/// what was actually read.
///
/// The mtime window then covers the gap the digests cannot: they are taken
/// when the matcher is published, which is after the builder read these files,
/// so a write landing between the two is recorded as if it had been read.
///
/// That window is widened by [`MTIME_GRANULARITY`] at the near end, because
/// `since` is a wall-clock instant with nanosecond precision and an mtime is
/// not. HFS+ and ext3 store whole seconds, FAT-derived filesystems two, so a
/// write that happens after `since` can be stamped before it and read as
/// historical. Over-triggering costs one rewalk that finds nothing; the slack
/// is bounded, so a file whose mtime keeps qualifying stops doing so as later
/// scans take later timestamps.
///
/// The far end is bounded too. On a network mount whose server clock runs
/// ahead of ours, every recently touched file carries a future mtime and would
/// pass a one-sided test — on every scan, including the one at the end of the
/// refresh this schedules, which walks the whole repository and then arms the
/// next. Treating a future mtime as skew rather than as an edit keeps that
