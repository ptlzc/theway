//! Source adapters for the runtime `NotificationHook` trait. Each module here wraps a
//! transport (MCP push, cron, file-watch, ...) and pushes normalized
//! [`Trigger`](theway_core::Trigger) envelopes into a shared sink.
//!
//! The runtime side of the trait + envelope lives in `theway_core::harness`. The
//! supervisor that owns hook registration (driver + pump task pair) shipped in
//! `AgentHarness::register_notification_hook`; `mcp_loader` constructs one
//! `McpNotificationHook` per configured MCP server and registers it with the harness
//! after the harness is built. Adapters are written without reference to the supervisor
//! so they can be unit-tested against a synthetic `TriggerSink` (a
//! `mpsc::unbounded_channel` receiver).
